<h3>How long can a dog survive without food and water?</h3>
<p class=paragraph3>Dogs can survive from 5 days to 3 weeks without food. It depends on the size and health of the dog, how much it is moving, and how hot it is. Dogs might stop eating if they are sick. If the dog doesn't eat for a few days, it could get worse.</p>
<p class=paragraph3>A few hours without water could be bad if it is hot. A dog could last up to four days without water, but it would need help to prevent long-term damage. If a dog is dehydrated, it would have a dry nose and gums, loss of appetite, panting,and sunken eyes. If it is hot outside, one day without water would be bad.</p>
<p class=paragraph3>If your dog won't eat or drink, you should call a vet. If a sick dog won't eat or drink, it might have an upset stomach.</p>
<p class=paragraph3>Try giving the dog a small spoonful of water. If the dog doesn't drink, try giving it chicken or beef broth.</p>
<p class=paragraph3>If you are leaving your dog at home, make sure it has plenty of water. If you are leaving for a long time, give your dog some food too.</p>
