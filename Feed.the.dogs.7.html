<h3>Switching Dog Food</h3>
<p class=paragraph6>You have to change diets gradually. If you switch dog food too quickly, it can cause vomiting, diarrhea, or gas. Dogs eat the same diet for a long time, so their digestive system isn't used to different food.</p>
<p class=paragraph6>When you are switching dry dog food, decrease the amount of dog food you give your dog. Measure with a cup the amount to give your dog. Add food to help digesting. Pumpkins and probiotics should be added. Feed half of the usual amount you give your dog.</p>

<p class=paragraph6>Good dog food has meat,vegetables, grains, and fruit. If your dog begs for food, don't give them your attention. People's food could be bad for dogs.</p>
