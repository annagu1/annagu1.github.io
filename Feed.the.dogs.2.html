<h3>Dog Not Eating?</h3>
<p class=paragraph1>If a dog isn't eating, it could be sick. Or, the dog could be hurting in its mouth. If a dog recently had vaccines, they might stop eating temporarily. If the dog has been in a car, it could stop eating because of car sickness. It depends on stomach sensitivity.</p>
<p class=paragraph1>Some dogs might stop eating because they want people food. Stop feeding the dog the people's food for a while.</p>
